The Student Malpractice Investigation System for Online Exams is a mini project designed to detect and analyze suspicious activities during online examinations. With the increasing adoption of digital exams, maintaining academic integrity has become a major concern. This project proposes a technology-assisted monitoring system that observes student behavior and flags potential malpractice using basic AI and rule-based techniques.
